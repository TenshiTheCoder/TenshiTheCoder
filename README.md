Hi, my name is Angel/Tenshi and I am an aspiring web developer. I am pretty new to coding but I'm constantly trying to improve and optimize my code. I am currently focusing on Front-End but will definitely try out Back-End and try to be a well-rounded developer. 
Currently I am working on getting a portfolio website up and running to host my solo projects.
